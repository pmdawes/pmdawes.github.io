## To Do: 
Navigation 
Different themes    
Exporting to PDF
Embed code blocks
Embed AI chatbot
Embed Plotly Dash
GitHub updating
Hosting on GitHub pages
Actually do the exercises... format/edit as I go along

Add sections on:

## Getting started with Sphinx
See NewSphinx.py for the code to create a new directory (in v1, in the archive)
Needed some manual modding - e.g. creating a docs folder (build/source), modding the config file for md not rst (see '03 Setting up Myst for md not rst support')

I didn't set it up in a virtual environment - this would have protected it from other libraries / extensions in my setup, making it more reliable / less likely a dependancy will break it. I think I need to in order to get the extensions (for jupyter etc) working

To build the document, in the terminal, execute:

sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/build/

I think collaborators could work on StackEdit connected to GitHub - a markdown environment through a web browser - so they could all edit.
